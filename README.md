# Gradify
The integrity and security of research reports are critical in academic institutions. Traditional paper-based signatures and approvals are prone to forgery and manipulation. With the digitization of research review systems, ensuring document authenticity and preventing unauthorized modifications has become essential. This paper proposes a cryptographic hashing mechanism for securing research reports and a structured pipeline to maintain evaluation integrity. By implementing SHA-256 hashing, digital signatures for mentor approvals, and a secure grading system, this approach ensures tamper-proof submissions, verified approvals, and immutable grading records. Additionally, we introduce a research evaluation pipeline where each stage is cryptographically linked, preventing unauthorized bypassing.
